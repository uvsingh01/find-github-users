# Random-user-Api

#### By Yuvraj Singh


# Description

 The code starts by creating a function called getUser that takes in the username as an argument. It then creates a variable called data which is set to be the response from axios, and it sets up two functions: createUserCard and getRepos. The code starts by calling the function with APIURL + username, which will return data for any user on GitHub who has their username as "username". The first thing this does is check if there was an error or not. If there wasn't, it calls createUserCard with the data returned from axios, which will make a card for that user on our website. Then we call getRepos with that same username to see what repositories they have created. The code is an example of how to use axios and createUserCard. The code above will attempt to fetch the user from the API and then it will create a card for that user. If there was an error, it will show a 404 response.
 
 # WHY this project was chosen ?
 
 Web API is a programming interface/application type that provides communication or interaction between software applications.
 Web API is often used to provide an interface for websites and client applications to have data access.
 Here i used async await to handle promise and learned about how to retrive the data from api and render on UI.

 The project Github user finder App is a mini project JavaScript. In which I have used HTML in little amount, CSS for styling and 
 JavaScript to handle the api.
