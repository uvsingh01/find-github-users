# Random-user-Api

#### By Yuvraj Singh


# Description

 In this project we use the URL of the random userme API, which will be used to get information about users on this website.
 These values are retrieved from the API using JavaScript's built-in JSON parsing function (JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation).
 There is a button when it clicked, it will send a request to the API for and available information about the user to display it on screen.
 The code is a simple example of how to use the RandomUser API.
 
 # WHY this project was chosen ?
 
 Web API is a programming interface/application type that provides communication or interaction between software applications.
 Web API is often used to provide an interface for websites and client applications to have data access.
 Here i used async awiat to handle promise and learned about how to retrive the data from api and render on UI.
